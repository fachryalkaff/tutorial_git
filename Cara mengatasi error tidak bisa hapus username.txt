Jika ada error seperti ini 
ORA-00604: error occurred at recursive SQL level 1
ORA-00942: table or view does not exist 

yang dilakukan adalah 
1. set ORACLE_HOME jika ORACLE_HOME tidak ada di system variables
2. Cari tempat instal oracle. Kalo pc saya di C:\oraclexe\app\oracle\product\11.2.0\server
3. Lalu cari file @$ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/admin/catqueue.sql . Kalo di pc saya path: @C:\oraclexe\app\oracle\product\11.2.0\server\rdbms\admin\catqueue.sql
4. jalankan script: @C:\oraclexe\app\oracle\product\11.2.0\server\rdbms\admin\catqueue.sql
5. Dan lihat lognya setelah jalankan script
